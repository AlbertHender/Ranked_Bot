Ranked Bot

This is a simple bot that is designed to act as your severs very own ranked system! With this you'll be able to rank and see who among your friends/members is among the best of the best in their respective server.

All you have to do to get started using this bot is making sure that you are registered into the system. To do so, just enter the slash command, /register. From that point you can start a game against another player by entering /startgame. 30 seconds will be given for another player to accept the match. After you and the other player finish your match it is the responsibility of the "host" of the game to end and report the score of the game. By entering /endgame followed by either a 1 , for team1, or a 0, for team 2, the game will end and your new ratings will be calculated.

Note: Your rank does not transfer to other servers that may have this bot added. Your rank is tied to whatever server it was obtained in. Meaning if you join another server, you are starting from 0 in that server but if your rank in the previous server is untouched. So you can have multiple ranks across different servers

Below is a list of the commands for this bot and their intended purposes:

/register - registers a user to the system to allow for them to participate in games
/startgame - "host" a game and allows for someone in the server to join (only have 30 seconds to respond once command is entered)
/endgame - ends the game and updates the ratings of the players who played in it
/players - shows a list of all the players registered
/getrating - shows the rating of the player who entered the command
/leaders - shows the top 10 players in the server and their rating
